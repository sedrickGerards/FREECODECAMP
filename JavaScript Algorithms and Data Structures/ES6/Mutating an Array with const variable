// Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.

// However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.
